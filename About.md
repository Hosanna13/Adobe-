# AE Audio Sync Plugin 
A plugin for Adobe After Effects that automatically transcribes audio and creates synced text layers for seamless subtitles or lyric videos.

# Purpose Behind the Pursuit
During my internship at the University of Cincinnati, I worked on enhancing shot detection in videos using color histograms. That project became the start of my interest in computer vision, inspired by that internship experience I decided to explore how the principles I learned from that internship, could apply to my favorite hobby: video editing. 

Video editing has always been a creative outlet for me. I enjoy transforming raw footage into engaging, polished content. However, very annoying, time-consuming, and repetitive tasks have been generating subtitles. This process is important, but it removes me from the creative flow of editing.

It made sense to combine my computer vision knowledge and my passion for video editing to solve this problem. I am developing a video subtitle generator specifically tailoed only for After Effetecs, for MAC, and soon Windows devices.
