# Video Subtitle Generator Script for Adobe After Effects

# Purpose Behind the Pursuit
Filmmaking and animation have always been an interest of mine since childhood. It was through film and animation that I connected with my family, especially during our weekly movie nights. One of my favorite shows to watch with my dad and cousin was Good Times. However, during the pandemic, things changed—my dad was separated by borders, and my cousin passed away. It became difficult for me to express myself or open up to others, but films became a way for me to communicate those emotions.

In high school, I started creating video edits to explore my passion for video production. I began with fan edits of my favorite shows and eventually ventured into creating my own animations. I primarily used Adobe AfterEffects, which offered a range of programs and scripts. However, I noticed that it lacked a key feature found in Premiere Pro—a subtitle generator. This realization inspired my goal to develop a JavaScript tool that can generate subtitles for videos.
