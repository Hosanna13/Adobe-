# Video Subtitle Generator Script for Adobe After Effects

# Purpose Behind the Pursuit
The most impressive and complex project I have worked on is the current project I am working on. This project is close to home, my family has a shared activity of watching movies together. With movies we also eat and sometimes from the sound of our crunching noises we can't hear the show we are watching, or the subtitles shown are not matching what the person is saying. This was something we used to do until my cousin died. We both had a shared interest in video editing, where we put clips together and add special effects. We always had built in subtitles in our videos but we did it manually each  and every time. We used Adobe After Effects for our video editing, so  I decided so create a subtile generator in Adobe After Effects using Python and Javasript. 

# Methodoly 
This project took a lot of work the hardest part was starting and fighting the mindset of  perfection. I wish I can say things got easier after that but it surely did not. The IDE I decided to use was Google Collabtory since it's pretty simple to use, creating the subtle generoators however  was not an easy feat. I had no idea were to go or start.
